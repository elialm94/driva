-- 23 · reset_demo_business: töm även payment_files
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- app.reset_demo_business (19) används av seed-skriptet (db:seed --demo) och
-- adaptertesterna för att tömma ett seedat demoföretag före återimport.
-- payment_files tillkom i en parallell migration och saknades i tömnings-
-- listan – utan raden kolliderar återimporten av exempeldatat på
-- payment_files primärnyckel. Full kropp från 19 + payment_files.
--
-- OBS: Den publika demon bor INTE i databasen (JSON-fil per besökare, se
-- src/lib/storage/demo-session-store.ts) – funktionen här är enbart ett
-- verktyg för utvecklar-seedade demoföretag.
